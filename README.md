Relearning to Think Like a Programmer

I’ve decided to start documenting my  coding challenges through FreeCodecamps daily chaleenges — not to show off progress, but to rebuild how I think about code.

Lately, I’ve realized that I’ve been too dependent on the internet and AI when solving problems. While these tools are helpful, they’ve made me skip the most important part of programming: thinking deeply and solving problems on my own.

This repo is my way of changing that. Each month, I’ll keep a record of my daily coding challenges — my solutions, mistakes, and what I learned along the way. The goal isn’t perfection, but consistency and growth.

I want to sharpen my logic, rebuild my confidence in problem analysis, and remind myself why I started coding in the first place — to create, learn, and think independently.
